## Smart Room Automation System  
### Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Room Automation System** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The system enables remote monitoring and automatic control of room appliances such as:
-  Room Lamp
-  Ceiling Fan  
The objective is to simulate an IoT-based smart room environment using networking concepts.

##  Project Objective
To design and configure a network-based automation system that:
- Automatically manages room lighting and fan
- Allows remote monitoring of devices
- Demonstrates IoT implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer

## System Architecture
The project includes:
- IoT Devices (Fan, Lamp)
- Home Gateway / Server
- End Devices (PC / Smartphone)
- Router / Switch
- Wireless Connectivity (if used)
The system simulates a smart room connected to a network for automation control.
